## Code of Conduct

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository
1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the project to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/paySphere.git
   cd paySphere
   ```

### 2. Set Up the Project Locally
PaySphere is divided into a Node.js/Express backend and a React (Vite) frontend.

#### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory based on the following template:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_secret
   ```
4. Start the backend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The backend API will run on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your code).

#### Frontend Setup
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory based on the following template:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_id
   ```
4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be accessible, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.
